# Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, and predicting churn helps companies take proactive retention measures. This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn using data science techniques such as data collection, exploration, feature engineering, model development, deployment, and MLOps.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
The project follows a structured pipeline:
1. **Data Collection & Exploration** - Acquire and analyze customer churn data.
2. **Feature Engineering** - Select and transform features for better prediction.
3. **Model Development & Optimization** - Train and evaluate machine learning models.
4. **Deployment & Monitoring** - Deploy the best model and set up monitoring.
5. **Final Documentation & Presentation** - Summarize insights and results.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualizations of customer behavior and churn trends.
- Feature correlation analysis and summary statistics.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
Implemented models for churn prediction:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**
- **Neural Networks** (Optional)

Evaluation metrics used:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

## 🛠️ Model Deployment
- Deployed the best-performing model using **Flask/FastAPI**.
- Optional: Hosted on **AWS/GCP/Azure**.
- **Monitoring**: Tracks performance and triggers retraining if drift is detected.

## 📥 Installation & Usage
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
cd Customer-Churn-Prediction

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
python -m venv venv

```

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Incorporate real-time data streams.
- Experiment with deep learning models.
- Improve feature engineering using NLP/Sentiment Analysis (if applicable).
- Enhance model interpretability with SHAP/LIME.

## 📌 Conclusion
This project provides a structured approach to predicting customer churn, helping businesses make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention. 🚀
